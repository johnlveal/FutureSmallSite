        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <br>
         <p>
            Future was born as Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn on November 20, 1983 in Atlanta, Georgia in a family of street hustlers. He attended Columbia High School.
As a child, Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn was one of the members of the musical collective ‘The Dungeon Family’. It was there that he was nicknamed Future, a name that stayed with him for the rest of his life. It was his cousin, Rico Wade who encouraged him to hone his writing skills and make a career out of rapping.

             From early 2010 to 2011, Future released a series of mixtapes titled ‘1000’, ‘Dirty Sprite’ ad ‘True Story’. In September 2011, he signed a major record deal with Epic Records fellow American rapper Rocko's A1 Recordings.
Future’s debut album ‘Pluto’ was released in April 2012. It included remixes of ‘Tony Montana’ featuring Drake and ‘Magic’ featuring T.I. ‘Magic’ went on to become Future’s first single to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ‘Pluto’ had inputs from Trae Tha Truth, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg. Later in 2012, Future wrote, produced and was featured on ‘Loveeeeeee Song’ taken from Barbadian singer Rihanna's seventh studio album ‘Unapologetic’.
Between 2014 and 2015, Future came up with three mixtapes, ‘Monster’, ‘Beast Mode’ and ’56 Nights’. Interestingly, all the mixtapes did exceedingly well earning much critical acclaim and appreciation.

             On July 2015, Future came up with his next successful album ‘DS2’. He followed it up with a collaborative mixtape, with Canadian rapper, Drake, titled ‘What a Time to Be Alive’ later in the year. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, Billboard R and B Charts and Billboard Hot Rap Songs thereby making Future the first rapper in more than a decade to have two number one albums in a year. The mixtape alone sold over 334,000 copies in the U.S.
On January 2016, Future released another mixtape titled ‘Purple Reign’. He immediately followed it up with his fourth studio album ‘EVOL’ that premiered on DJ Khaled's debut episode of the Beats 1 radio show ‘We The Best’. With the release of his fourth album, Future became the fastest artist to have three number-one albums on the Billboard 200 since Glee soundtrack albums in 2010.
On February 2017, Future came up with his eponymous fifth studio album. While his fans were soaking in the ecstasy of his new album, Future showered them with yet another new album, his sixth titled ‘HNDRXX’. Both the albums went number one consecutively, thereby making Future the first artist to debut two albums at number one at the same time on the Billboard 200 and Canadian Albums Chart.
